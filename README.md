# My projects on Udacity
Thoughtout the Udacity's deep learning nanodegree program, I have to work on multiple projects.

## Bake Sharing Prediction
In this project, I own a store that rent bikes. Using a dataset containing numbers 
like the amount of bikes rented, temperature, season and wind speed at every hour, 
I have to build a neural network from scratch that predicts the number of bikes I will rent depending on those factors.
