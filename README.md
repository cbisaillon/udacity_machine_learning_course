# My projects on Udacity
Thoughtout the Udacity's deep learning nanodegree program, I have to work on multiple projects.

## Bake Sharing Prediction
In this project, I own a store that rent bikes. Using a dataset containing numbers 
like the amount of bikes rented, temperature, season and wind speed at every hour, 
I have to build a neural network from scratch that predicts the number of bikes I will rent depending on those factors.

## Dog breed classifier
The aim of this project, is to create a neural network able to classify the breed of a dog given an image.
To give more challenge, I was asked to check if there is a human in the image before classifying the dog breed.
I created a CNN from scratch that is able to classify the images with an accuracy of 13%. I then tried to fine tune a pre-trained version of VGG16 to get an accuracy of 75%.

## Text generator letter by letter
In this exercise, I train a RNN to predict a letter based on the past letters by feeding it the content of the book
Anna Karenina by Leo Tolstoy. It successfully generate words that make sense, but since I am only giving one letter at time,
the words does not make sense with the other words arround them. 

## Sentiment Analysis
In this exercise, I am training a RNN to prefict if a movie review is positive of negative.

## CycleGan - Winter to Summer
In this mini project, I built a CycleGan architecture that learns to transforms an summer landscape image into a winter landscape image.
